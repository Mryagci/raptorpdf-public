# RaptorPDF – Privacy-First Online PDF Editor

[RaptorPDF](https://www.raptorpdf.com) is a free, browser-based PDF tool that runs entirely on your device.  
No file uploads, no accounts, no paywalls – everything happens locally in your browser.

## 🔐 Privacy-First by Design

Most “free online PDF editors” upload your files to a remote server.  
RaptorPDF is different:

- No sign-up, no tracking pixels for editing
- No document uploads – everything is processed using your browser’s JavaScript engine
- Perfect for sensitive documents, contracts, IDs, and business files

## 🛠 Tech & Architecture (High-Level)

> Note: The **core source code is private**.  
> This repository is a public overview for documentation and discovery.

- Frontend-only architecture (runs in the browser)
- Heavy use of client-side PDF & image processing libraries
- No backend required for core PDF operations
- Designed to be fast even on mid-range devices
